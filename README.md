You can get the userID in the URL when you go to a Yelp user profile:

<img width="878" alt="UserID" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43122789/175792797-b96adfd5-5abd-49ee-bfc9-2d8106effbb5.png">

#### Note

Because of Google Geocoding API usage limits, the higher the requested number of reviews, the longer the app will take to load.
